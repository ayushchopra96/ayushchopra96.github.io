## Abstract

Cardiotocogram is a device used to record mother and child vitals, including heart rate & contractions, during labour. Specialist doctors interpret the readings, and analyse them to take critical decisions during child birth. <br>However, despite the presence of mechanisms to record and analyse data, mother-child fatalities at birth continue to be a harsh reality, particularly in remote areas. This is largely driven by the lack of ready availability of high skilled doctors to track and analyse these recordings.<br>

smartCTG, is a cheap and portable extension for existing machines, to aid real time inference of the generated data stream. <br>It uses a simple raspberry-pi, with a camera and wifi module, to run our Computer Vision algorithms that record and analyse data. It can be seamlessly interfaced with any existing CTG machine.
