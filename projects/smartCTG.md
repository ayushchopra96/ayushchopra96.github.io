## Abstract

Cardiotocogram is a device used to record mother and child vitals, including heart rate & contractions, during labour. Specialist doctors interpret the readings, and use the inference to take critical decisions during child birth. However, despite the availability of mechanisms to record and analyse data, mother-child fatalities at birth continue to be a harsh reality, particularly in remote areas. This is largely driven by the lack of ready availability of high skilled doctors to track and analyse these recordings.<br>

smartCTG, is a cheap and portable extension for existing machines, to aid real time inference of the generated data stream. In the absence of a doctor, smartCTG provides a mechanism to continually analyse the data and track severity of situations.<br>

smartCTG, uses a simple raspberry-pi with a camera and wifi module, and can be seamlessly interfaced with any existing CTG machine.
