## Abstract
Over the last few years, Deep Learning research has been progressing at a very fast pace. A lot of interesting ideas are proposed.
I believe that the best way to ingrain these is to reproduce the results.
Offlate, I am trying to make it a habit to implement the interesting ideas I come across.
