## Abstract
Growing up in an academic environment, I was always awestruck when I saw my mother teaching classes at the University of Delhi.
In October 2017, I started collaborating with <a href="www.codingblocks.com">Coding Blocks</a>, a Nagarro backed ed-tech venture based out of Delhi. On the weekends, I taught hands-on introduction to machine learning. <br>
I tried to implement all my learnings over the last couple of years across several projects and work initiatives. I had a great experience interacting with students across an electic demographic ranging from college freshman to industry professional from fortune-500 companies. <br>

Some critical aspects I tried to focus on: <br>
- Laying emphasis on building the underlying mathematical logic by implementing all machine learning algorithms from scratch. <br>
- Exploring the tricks of Data Engineering, processing and augmentation, which I feel are very critical skills in trying to take a project to production. <br>
- Discussing the ideas behind state-of-art approaches for various tasks and encouraging students to read literature
