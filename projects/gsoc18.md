## Abstract
Ignorant dietary consumption is a major cause for lifestyle diseaes in the 21st century. Technology can play a major role to deliver awareness to people regarding their dietary consumption, enabling them to make smarter decisions.

During the summer of 2018, I was a Google Summer of Code Mentor with <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2018/organizations/5395828684357632/" target="_blank">Open Food Facts</a><br>
I supervised development of a tool to extract and analyse dietary information from nutritional fact table available on products.<br>The project was integrated into the OFF mobile application that currently has over 100k users worldwide.<br>
It had 3 major components: 
1. Table Detection
2. Text Detection
3. OCR (with post processing)
<br>
The lead developer was <a href="https://github.com/sgrpanchal31">Sagar Panchal</a>, a GSoC student I supervised.
