## Abstract
Present work focusses on the antistatic and biocidal performance (i.e.removal of E.coli and Total coliform (TC) bacteria) of fabric modified with polyaniline microtubes. Polyaniline coated fabric has been developed by chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline in presence of naphthalene sulphonic acid as a dopant. Coating of polymer on fabric material was carried out during polymerization in different concentration. Conducting polymer coated fabrics were characterized by TGA analysis, FTIR spectroscopy and XRD analysis and conductivity measurement, which indicate that the inclusion of polyaniline microtubes into the fabric matrix. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed the surface morphology of the material. Evaluation of the membrane for antimicrobial activity (removal of Total coliform and E.coli) has been carried out by
membrane filtration method. M-Endo broth was used for selectively isolated coliform bacteria from water using membrane filtration method. Data will be compared with uncoated fabric and polyaniline doped with benzene sulphonic acid. Results revealed that polyaniline microtubes coated fabric showed upto 75-85 % reduction of E.coli and Total coliform bacteria from waste water. Moreover, Antistatic performance of the polyaniline impregnated fabric was investigated by John Chubb Instrument. The static decay time of the coated fabric was found to be in the range 0.9 to 10.2 s on recording the decay time from 5000 V to 500 V. The effect of morphology on antisatic and biocidal properties is also analysed.
