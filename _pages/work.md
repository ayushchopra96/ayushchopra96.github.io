## Overview
* During my brief professional journey, I have had the opportunity to gain diverse experiences in research, product, and teaching. As a researcher, I started in polymer chemistry before delving into computer science where I have explored an eclectic mix of fundamental and applied problems. I have had the opportunity to work on diverse product use-cases in multi-cultural professional settings. I worked on a video communication platform as part of a 5-person team distributed over 3 continents (RemoteHQ). Working for a $150 billion company with over 10k employees, I built solutions for Fashion and Marketing (Adobe). As a GSoC mentor, I supervised projects in computational nutrition for a French organization with developers from China, India and the US. During my time as an ML instructor (Coding Blocks), I taught students from different backgrounds including consulting, design, medicine, etc.
